# How does that PySpark thing work? And why Arrow makes it faster?

Presentation I ([@berenguel](https://twitter.com/berenguel)) gave at the [PyBCN
meetup](https://www.meetup.com/python-185/) on June 2018, [Spark
London](https://www.meetup.com/Spark-London/) on September 2018 and [Spark
Barcelona](https://www.meetup.com/Spark-Barcelona/) to explain how Spark 2.3 has
optimised UDFs for Pandas use as well as how PySpark works. A recording of this
talk (the one given in Python Barcelona, in English) is available
[here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=698441URsrc), you can find the slides on
[Slideshare](https://www.slideshare.net/rberenguel/speeding-up-pyspark-with-arrow)
or
[here](https://github.com/rberenguel/pyspark-arrow-pandas/raw/master/pyspark.pdf).
I recommend you check the version with [presenter
notes](https://github.com/rberenguel/pyspark-arrow-pandas/raw/master/pyspark-with-notes.pdf)
which is only available here.

If you want additional information about Spark in general, I gave an
introduction to Spark talk with [Carlos Pe√±a](http://twitter.com/crafty_coder)
that you can find [here](https://github.com/rberenguel/WelcomeToApacheSpark).

This presentation is formatted in Markdown and prepared to be used with
[Deckset](https://www.decksetapp.com/). The drawings were done on an iPad Pro
using [Procreate](https://procreate.art). **Here only the final PDF and the
source Markdown are available**. Sadly the animated gifs are just static images
in the PDF.
